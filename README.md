### üìÅ Projects

Here are some highlights from my project portfolio:

### [Query Genius](https://github.com/djibygass/QueryGenius) ... in progress
- **Overview:**<br>

This project is a web application designed to convert natural language text into SQL queries using a fine-tuned OpenAI GPT model. Here are the most important steps of the project :<br>
  **Model FineTuning**: Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 on Custom Dataset with sql queries.<br>
  **API Integration**: Utilizes a fine-tuned OpenAI GPT model through an API.<br>
  **Cloud Storage**: Stores session data and user queries securely in the cloud using AWS.<br>
  **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements deep reinforcement learning to refine and improve the model based on user interactions and feedback.<br>
  **Generative Prompt Engineering**: Evaluates prompt results with zero shot and few shot pormpting.
  **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: evaluates performance with a RAG
  **CI/CD Integration**

  - **Technologies Used:** AWS - Boto3 - Flask - Pandas - OpenAI API for accessing the GPT model


### [Energy Tracker](https://github.com/yasser3434/energy)
- **Overview:**<br>
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to handle the upload, storage, and processing of PDF documents. Here are the most important steps of the project : <br>

  **File Upload**: Support PDFs.<br>
  **File Management**: Files are categorized by company and stored accordingly.<br>
  **Data Extraction**: Extracts specific details from PDF invoices such as client information and billing details.<br>
  **Data Visualization**: Provides visual feedback on the data extracted from invoices.<br>
  **Database Integration**: Stores extracted data in an AWS RDS MySQL database.

- **Technologies Used:** AWS (Boto3 - RDS - S3) - Flask - Pandas - PyMySQL - PyMuPDF (fitz) - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

### [MLOps Pipeline for ML Model Serving](https://github.com/ICollaps/ZenML-project)
- **Overview:**<br>
  This project leverages ZenML, an MLOps framework to build, deploy, and monitor machine learning models. Here are the most important steps of the project : <br>
  
  **Automated ML Pipeline**: End-to-end automation from data loading to model deployment.<br>
  **Model Versioning**: Integrates with MLflow for model tracking and versioning.<br>
  **Model Serving**: Utilizes FastAPI for serving predictions via a RESTful API.<br>
  **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitors the model's performance and updates the model automatically if necessary.<br>
  **Discord Notifications**: Sends alerts and notifications via Discord based on pipeline events and model performance.<br>

- **Technologies Used:** ZenML - MLflow - FastAPI - Tensorflow - scikit-learn - joblib - pandas - uvicorn
